Seals: know which parts of the model to re-check when code changes.

`archdoc seal` records a fingerprint of the code each model fact points at in `.archdoc/archdoc.sum`. An element's paths are fingerprinted by the files it owns and the names they export, so a new file or a renamed export breaks the seal and a function body doesn't. Snippets, decisions, mappings, and contracts are fingerprinted by their lines (without comments and whitespace), journey steps by their entry file's exports, and data entries by their schema's fields.

`archdoc check` reports `seal/changed` (with what changed) and `seal/unsealed` when a repository has an `archdoc.sum`, and with `--base` only what the change caused, so the PR comment lists them under "To check". `archdoc verify` lists the facts to re-check, with what changed and where each fact is in the model, and exits 1 while there are any. `archdoc seal <fact|element-id> --by <who>` records that someone checked. Without facts, it seals only new facts and keeps changed ones flagged, and `--all` seals everything. The PR comment says which facts a change sealed again, and who did. MCP adds `archdoc_verify` and `archdoc_seal`, which writes only `archdoc.sum`.
