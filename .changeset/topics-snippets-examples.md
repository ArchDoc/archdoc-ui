Pub-sub is a topic on the arrow. Contracts and relationships take a `transport` (http, grpc, kafka, sqs, eventbridge, or anything else). Core's `subscriptionOf` says when a relationship subscribes to a topic or event, and a journey step's message says when its data goes against the step (`against`), such as a subscriber's step to what it subscribes to. The explorer draws subscriptions from the publisher to the subscriber, labelled with their channel and transport, and plays messages, message focus, and journey steps the way the data goes. Tables inside an opened datastore take the datastore's emphasis instead of looking disabled.

Code references can point at snippets: a line range (`lines: 40-88`) or a declaration (`symbol: Checkout::PlaceOrder.call`). `check` warns when a snippet no longer matches the code (`drift/stale-snippet`). `archdoc show <element> --code` and the new `archdoc_code` MCP tool print each snippet's text, so an agent reads the right lines before searching. In the explorer, every snippet links to its lines and shows them: `archdoc view` finds where each symbol's declaration is (core's `resolveSnippets`), and flags a snippet that no longer matches the code.

`archdoc diff a.yaml b.yaml`, `archdoc report --base a.yaml`, and `archdoc view --base a.yaml` compare two model files without git. The PR report counts a changed relationship as touching the element it starts from, so its journeys are listed. `archdoc view` finds `<journey>.sample.json` files next to a model. A reference like `shop.orders` now resolves to that element even when the namespace is also `shop`.

The examples are one flat folder: a quickstart, a modular monolith with components and snippets, an event-driven system, decisions, a big schema, and sensitive data. Three variants of the quickstart show changes to compare, and `examples/org/` (formerly `examples/acme/`) is the multi-repo demo.
